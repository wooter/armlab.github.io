Generali contacted us about their web front infrastructure. As one of the insurance companies in Belgium, Generali needed an overhaul of their web infrastructure, and was looking to improve on matters of disaster recovery, load balancing and security.

We designed a complete web front infrastructure environment, which encompasses a cloud deployed on two physical sites which host a number of virtual servers, on which a dynamic failover of data and services is possible in case of any large-scale disaster.

The designed environment also features infrastructure and application monitoring on all servers and network components, and a standardized platform for each server to enable quick provisioning and server independence for the hosted applications.

## Details

* Failover and Disaster Recovery infrastructure
* Infrastructure and Application Monitoring and Management
* Improved confidentiality, integrity through stringent security measures
* Multiple netwerk segments, divided through reverse proxies and firewalls
